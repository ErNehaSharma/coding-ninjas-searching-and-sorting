You have been given two sorted arrays/lists(ARR1 and ARR2) of size N and M respectively, merge them into a third array/list such that the third array is also sorted.
Note:
Input Format :
The first line contains an Integer 't' which denotes the number of test cases or queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.

First line of each test case or query contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the first array/list.

Second line contains 'N' single space separated integers representing the elements of the first array/list.

Third line contains an integer 'M' representing the size of the second array/list.

Fourth line contains 'M' single space separated integers representing the elements of the second array/list.
Output Format :
For each test case, print the sorted array/list(of size N + M) in a single row, separated by a single space.

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.
Constraints :
1 <= t <= 10^2
0 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= M <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec 
Note:
Consider the case when size of the two arrays is not same.
Sample Input 1 :
1
5
1 3 4 7 11
4
2 4 6 13
Sample Output 1 :
1 2 3 4 4 6 7 11 13 
Sample Input 2 :
2
3
10 100 500
7
4 7 9 25 30 300 450
4
7 45 89 90
0
Sample Output 2 :
4 7 9 10 25 30 100 300 450 500
7 45 89 90

def mergeSortedArrays(arr1, n, arr2, m):
    i = 0  # Pointer for arr1
    j = 0  # Pointer for arr2
    merged = []  # Output array/list

    while i < n and j < m:
        if arr1[i] <= arr2[j]:
            merged.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1

    # Add remaining elements from arr1, if any
    while i < n:
        merged.append(arr1[i])
        i += 1

    # Add remaining elements from arr2, if any
    while j < m:
        merged.append(arr2[j])
        j += 1

    return merged

# Read the number of test cases
t = int(input())

for _ in range(t):
    # Read the size of the first array/list
    n = int(input())

    # Read the elements of the first array/list if n > 0
    arr1 = []
    if n > 0:
        arr1 = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Read the size of the second array/list
    m = int(input())

    # Read the elements of the second array/list if m > 0
    arr2 = []
    if m > 0:
        arr2 = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Merge the sorted arrays/lists
    merged = mergeSortedArrays(arr1, n, arr2, m)

    # Print the merged and sorted array/list
    print(*merged)
